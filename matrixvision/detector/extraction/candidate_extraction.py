        regardless of their size difference. Each box absorbs every box it
        overlaps into a growing union; passes repeat until stable, so chains of
        fragments (e.g. a DMC shattered into many small boxes on a noisy
        surface) merge transitively. Boxes that overlap nothing are kept as-is.

        each other are merged regardless of the overlap coefficient (proximity
        clustering — what reassembles a fragmented DMC, whose fragment boxes
        are adjacent rather than overlapping). With ``gap = 0`` only the
        overlap-coefficient criterion applies (redundancy removal).
